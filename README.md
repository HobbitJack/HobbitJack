## Hi!
I am a university student at Michigan State University!
I study Astrophysics and am in my second year (of three).

I enjoy writing simple software for getting my work done. I'm not huge on big and flashy projects but instead prefer creating the tools I actually want and need.

I love FOSS and most of my projects are released under MIT or GPLv3+.

## My Projects
- Typset is a small typsetting software for printing nice-looking plaintext documents.
- ExtraTextutils is a package of Unix-like text utilities that replace seedy `sed(1)` or `awk(1)` commands.
- plansh is a work-in-progress Bash-based planner suite with a todo manager, notes, and eventually a calendar.
