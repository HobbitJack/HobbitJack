Hi there! I'm an Astrophyics sophmore at Michigan State University!
I love writing simple tools in Bash and Python to get my work done!

## My Projects
- Typset is a simple typesetting package for making simple but clean plaintext documents.
- ExtraTextutils is a package of Unix-like utilities for working with text. Most of these replace seedy `sed(1)` or `awk(1)` commands.
