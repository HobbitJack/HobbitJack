Hi there! I'm an Astrophyics sophmore at Michigan State University!
I love writing simple tools in Bash and Python to get my work done!

## My Projects
- Typset is a simple typesetting package for making simple but clean plaintext documents.
- ExtraTextutils is a package of Unix-like utilities for working with text. Most of these replace seedy `sed(1)` or `awk(1)` commands.
- `grammar` is a command-line grammer checker based on the work-in-progress `harper` library and the `harper-c` FFI for said library.
